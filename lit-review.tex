ARE: Mixture of NaF, $ZrF_4$ and $UF_4$, moderator BeO.  Thermal neutrons, fast-breeder required very high power densities. 2.5MWt, 113K. \cite{msrhistory}

Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE): mixture of $UF_4$ enriched to 33\% ($^{235}U$), lithium-7, Be, ZrF (melting point 434\celsius + Hastelloy-N (nickel-based alloy) + unclad graphite serves as a moderator. Secondary circuit salt was lithium+beryllium fluoride (FLiBe) (melting point 455\celsius) ~8MWt (heat power), 920K.

MSBR: Fuel consist $UF_4$ and $ThF_4$ dissolved in fluoride of lithium and beryllium. Two-fluid systems showed breeding ratios of 1.07 to 1.08, but graphite for pipes - bad idea. Works both on $^{233}U$ (thorium cycle) and $^{235}U$
